I'm a software engineer who works primarily in Rust. I also make [music](/music). I have two cats and enjoy hockey.

Some things I'm proud of:
* I was the second engineer at [Osmos](osmos.io), and built out the in-house AI there.
* I created the [Sway Programming Language](github.com/fuellabs/sway) and cut my compiler chops there. I have many opinions on languages and future languages I want to create, and I'm thankful to Fuel for giving me the chance to make a real compiler for real users. It has informed my experience and expertice greatly.
* I created the [Sky Programming Language](github.com/sezna/sky) ([playground](sky-lang.net)), which to be honest, is a bit of a mess code-wise, but it was a fun experience and I learned that TS/JS are not at all suitable for compiler development. I'd like to revisit the idea of it someday.
