To see my only formally released album, check out our [bandcamp page](https://tx-alchemist.bandcamp.com/releases). Instrumental metal.

To see my personal demos as they accumulate towards an eventual album, check out my [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/ahansen14). I write mostly metal, but there are some other things interspersed in there as well.

If you're in Seattle/PNW and would like to write this kind of music together, I'm always interested in collaborating. Contact me by [sending me an email](mailto:alex@alex-hansen.com).
