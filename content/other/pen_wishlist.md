This is my pen wishlist. I'm looking to acquire all of the following pens, so if you have one for sale, please get in contact with me.

* Namiki Emperor (old or new nib)
* Armando Simoni Club Bologna Extra Arco
* Wahl Eversharp Decoband Superflex (the new model)
* Sailor KOP with inverted 2-tone nib (primary silver; gold lines) (Asian Way is the only one I know of)
* Looking for some sort of Danitrio to start the Danitrio section of my collection
* ~~Visconti Homo Sapiens Bronze Age Maxi w/ 2-tone nib (surprisingly hard to track doWn these days)~~
* Namiki Yukari Milky Way
* Sailor KOP Pro Gear
