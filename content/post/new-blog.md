Programming languages, and to a lesser extent software technologies in general, have an annoying tendency to polarize and fanaticize fanbases. Inherent in tauting benefits and advantages over other systems is implicit disapproval of systems which do not uphold the same standard or principle. This trend almost definitely exists beyond my field of software, but from my narrow world view, and especially as a Rust programmer, I can only observe it in this context. 
This is, of course, not the fault of any one technology itself. And one could argue it is an inevitability from the moment somebody becomes a proponent or representative of a technology. It requires an active and intentional shift in discourse and mindset to succumb to a reality check of the inherent marketing. 
Choosing the right tool for the job is an important skill. I'd reckon that also spans beyond my field. It is made more difficult to discern proper tooling if one finds themselves to have taken up arms for any particular faction, or even to have developed skill in one such technology. In a perfect world, all engineers would be fully masterful in all candidate technologies, belong to no fanbases, and predict the interplay of project requirements and technology offerings without fault.
This situation will never arise in any of our careers, but it is still a skill that can be honed. 
The luxury of picking a tool is not always something big, like what language to use, what framework to develop in, what computers to buy; it can be `.map()` vs. a `for` loop or writing an abstraction vs copying and pasting _just one more time_. 
# Being a generalist
# Keep track of priorities and tradeoffs and be able to tweak them for specific outputs
# - is time a factor? tweak. is robustness a factor? tweak.
# For any advantage, assess the tradeoff/disadvantage. Rust -- no GC/borrow checker
# is velocity a factor? if yes, skill is important. if not, learning is important.
# negotiation tactics
# Inspiration
