Everybody has a "crypto origin story". In my case, I was baited. 

I have always loved building compilers. In my spare time at school, and later after work, I'd always be building various hobbyist compilers. None of my compilers really ever took off, not that I even tried to make them take off. But, when 2020 rolled around, I had a decent resume of compiler projects. Additionally, I'd been deep in the Rust community since early 2016 or so.

When I started building Sway, I knew very little about blockchain. This was actually by design. A choice made by John (Adler -- co-founder of Fuel). When you filter on a certain skillset _and_ depth in the crypto space, your talent pool becomes very small. Fuel acquired its considerably advanced talent pool by hiring subject matter experts and onboarding them to crypto. I didn't know this at the time, but I was about to receive one of the most first-class crash courses in cryptography and blockchain: weekly, if not daily, tutorials and explanations from John Adler, co-founder of Celestia and Fuel Labs.

Over the next year or so, Sway gained more traction and more people began contributing to the compiler. At this time, more compiler experts took interest in the project. I feel incredibly lucky, as some very experienced compiler developers took what I had built and applied their experience to it. In this process, I got a first-class compiler education, as well. I found it validating, as well, that these experts with many years of experience building compilers were able to jump right in with Sway. 

As Sway grew, I of course became intimitely familiar with the Fuel protocol. This was necessary in order to build Sway. I still lacked a broader ecosystem perspective, though. That came later -- in the adoption phase.

The compiler eventually became usable -- an MVP. It didn't have much in the way of optimizations, and it was missing some features, but it was entirely usable to create applications for the FuelVM. This was when adoption skyrocketed. Fuel launched a grants program to incentivize developers to build on our platform, and the natural ecosystem interest also boomed. Naturally, I participated in the ecosystem and tried to help out new Sway developers where I could. As an aside, it is both a fulfilling and an alarming feeling when you see a workshop full of people writing in the language that you created. You never feel like it is ready! Anyway, during this time I learned about how exactly a lot of common ecosystem projects are structured. I code reviewed a Uniswap clone, multiple DEXs, NFT marketplaces, a naming service, and more -- all written in Sway. These were more or less translations from the Ethereum ecosystem.

At this point, I began to see the true utility of the crypto and web3 ecosystem. If you think I should have felt that way earlier, consider this: I hadn't written a lot of Sway at all. I hadn't interacted with any smart contracts or built any dApps. I had spent two years building a compiler in Rust. I was not experiencing the decentralized applications that the blockchain enables. Up until the adoption phase, I was still just a compiler developer who happened to work in the crypto space
