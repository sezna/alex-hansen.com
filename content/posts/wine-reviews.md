|Mark Ryan| 2018 | Red Blend          | Walla Walla, WA    | Long Haul             | |

On the _nose_, blackberry, dark cherry.

On the _palate_, wow this is good. Cherry, blackberry, bit of chocolate. Muuuch smoother than the Faust from yesterday, and accordingly, the finish is less aggressive.

On the _finish_, definitely short and without any significant punch. 

4/5 -- this one is really good, and could be stocked as a "nice wine".

# Faust 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon
#### 2021-12-29
| Company | Year | Type               | Location           | Name                  | Details                         |

| Faust   | 2018 | Cabernet Sauvignon | Napa Valley        | Cabernet Sauvignon    | |

On the _nose_, very light strawberry and dark cherries, a sweeter nose. A dark currant smell combines with the strawberry and kind of reminds me of a dark rum?

On the _palate_, cooling, tart, and acidic. Aggressive dark cherry, agressive chocolate.

On the _finish_, drying and tart. 

Very powerful to just drink on its own -- accompanies a meal perfectly. This would go well with lamb or steak. Maybe too powerful to just casually drink without food?

3/5, too punchy off the bat, and I was kind of tired of it by the end of the glass.


# Apothic Cabernet

| Apothic | 2019 | Cabernet Sauvignon | Modesto, California| Apothic Cab           | |

On the _nose_, very familiar scent, cherry and strawberry. Bit of blackberry

On the _palate_, smooth and sweet. More typical strawberry notes.

On the _finish_, brief and sweet.

A prototypical inoffensive cabernet. Probably good to stock for things like sangria or friends who don't like stronger flavors,
but I definitely prefer more bite and complexity. Given the price of $7 at Fred Meyer, I could understand keeping some around.
Better than other things at that price.

3/5 due to price. 2/5 if it cost more.

# 2019 Domaine Saint Andre Blanc
#### 2021-10-30
| Company             | Year | Type             | Location           | Name   | Details                         |
|---------------------|------|------------------|--------------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| Domaine Saint Andre | 2018 | Dry White Blend  | France             | Blanc  | 50% Chardonnay 50% Vermentino (approx)

On the _nose_, butter, honey, peach. 

On the _palate_, a bit bitter. Fuji apple. Little bit...salty? More peach. 

On the _finish_, the sweetness fades away pretty quickly to some bitterness then goes away.

Overall, not terrible, but not a buy-again. Just pretty meh -- it would be better if it was a straight ahead sweetness
or a more complex flavor, but the way it starts sweet and goes bitter is off putting.

2/5
# Hess Select North Coast Cabernet Sauvignon 2018
#### 2021-10-30
| Company | Year | Type               | Location           | Name                  | Details                         |
|---------|------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Hess    | 2018 | Cabernet Sauvignon | Napa Valley        | Hess Select North Coast Cabernet Sauvignon | |

On the _nose_, strawberries, raisin. Light and sweet. Strawberry jam, vanilla.

On the _palate_, more strawberry, raisin, fresh grape. Very sweet with hints of citrus, vanilla, and some cocoa. 

On the _finish_, subtle and not very acidic. Does not go on for too long, and is overall enjoyable.

This is a very easy to drink cabernet. Predominantly strawberry with hints of cocoa, if I had to characterize it. Very 
well done and not too challenging to understand.

_note: Mary hated this wine and said it tastes like dirt._

3.5/5

# Tapiz Alta Collection Cabernet Sauvignon 2018
#### 2021-10-29
| Company | Year | Type               | Location           | Name                  | Details                         |
|---------|------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Tapiz   | 2018 | Cabernet Sauvignon | Mendoza, Argentina | Tapiz Alta Collection | San Pablo Vineyard - Uco Valley |

On the _nose_, strong cherry, raisin, oak.

On the _palate_, sour and dry. Acidic. Thick. Blackberry.

On the _finish_, drying and tart with sour notes persisting.

Not my favorite type of cabernet. Too sour and tart. 

2/5
