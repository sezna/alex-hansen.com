# 2019 Domaine Saint Andre Blanc
#### 2021-10-30

| Domaine Saint Andre | 2018 | Dry White Blend  | France             | Blanc  | 50% Chardonnay 50% Vermentino (approx)

On the _nose_, butter, honey, peach. 

On the _palate_, a bit bitter. Fuji apple. Little bit...salty? More peach. 

On the _finish_, the sweetness fades away pretty quickly to some bitterness then goes away.

Overall, not terrible, but not a buy-again. Just pretty meh -- it would be better if it was a straight ahead sweetness
or a more complex flavor, but the way it starts sweet and goes bitter is off putting.

2/5


# Hess Select North Coast Cabernet Sauvignon 2018

| Hess    | 2018 | Cabernet Sauvignon | Napa Valley        | Hess Select North Coast Cabernet Sauvignon | |

On the _nose_, strawberries, raisin. Light and sweet. Strawberry jam, vanilla.

On the _palate_, more strawberry, raisin, fresh grape. Very sweet with hints of citrus, vanilla, and some cocoa. 

On the _finish_, subtle and not very acidic. Does not go on for too long, and is overall enjoyable.

This is a very easy to drink cabernet. Predominantly strawberry with hints of cocoa, if I had to characterize it. Very 
well done and not too challenging to understand.

_note: Mary hated this wine and said it tastes like dirt._

3.5/5

| Tapiz   | 2018 | Cabernet Sauvignon | Mendoza, Argentina | Tapiz Alta Collection | San Pablo Vineyard - Uco Valley |

On the _nose_, strong cherry, raisin, oak.

On the _palate_, sour and dry. Acidic. Thick. Blackberry.

On the _finish_, drying and tart with sour notes persisting.

Not my favorite type of cabernet. Too sour and tart.
