      <description>To see my only formally released album, check out our bandcamp page. Instrumental metal.
To see my personal demos as they accumulate towards an eventual album, check out my soundcloud. I write mostly metal, but there are some other things interspersed in there as well.
If you&amp;rsquo;re in Seattle/PNW and would like to write this kind of music together, I&amp;rsquo;m always interested in collaborating. Contact me by sending me an email.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer who works primarily in Rust. I also make music. I have two cats and enjoy hockey.
Some things I&amp;rsquo;m proud of:
I was the second engineer at Osmos, and built out the in-house AI there. I created the Sway Programming Language and cut my compiler chops there. I have many opinions on languages and future languages I want to create, and I&amp;rsquo;m thankful to Fuel for giving me the chance to make a real compiler for real users.</description>
